# Introduction
This repo contains coding problems appeared in online campus placement tests across IITs, IIITs, and other top engineering colleges in India and also implementations of some common data structures and algorithms.

# Template
Each file is structured as follows:

    1. There is a commented block at the top which has following informations in order
        i. First block of lines clearly explains the Problem Statement
        ii. Next block of lines contains relevant constraints on input variables as appeared in the PS (not updated for all problems.)
    2. Then follows a working solution to the mentioned problem in any language, mostly C++.(Sometimes python. Python is mostly used to solve problems involving heavy pre/post-processing of strings.)
